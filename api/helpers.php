const DEFAULT_TERMS_MD = <<<'TERMS'
## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By creating a patient account with Cana Optical Clinic ("the Clinic"), you agree to be bound by these Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, please do not proceed with registration.

## 2. Account Registration
You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration. You are responsible for keeping your password confidential and for all activity under your account. Notify the Clinic immediately if you suspect unauthorized use.

## 3. Your Patient QR Code
Upon registration, a unique QR code is generated and linked to your patient record. Present this QR code at the clinic for fast, accurate check-in. Do not share it with anyone else — it provides access to your health information.

## 4. Appointments
Appointment requests submitted through this system are subject to confirmation by clinic staff based on doctor availability. The Clinic reserves the right to reschedule or decline requests when necessary.

## 5. Use of the Platform
You agree to use this system only for legitimate healthcare purposes related to your own care. Misuse — including attempting to access another patient's records or interfering with the system's normal operation — may result in account suspension.

## 6. Changes to these Terms
The Clinic may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time. Continued use of your account after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
TERMS;

// ── Default registration Data Privacy Act Notice ───────────────────
// Served whenever clinic_settings.privacy_content is NULL. Split out of
// DEFAULT_TERMS_MD into its own document/checkbox — a Data Privacy Act
// consent bundled inside a generic "I agree to the Terms" checkbox didn't
// read as the patient having actually consented to it specifically, which
// is the whole point of calling it out under RA 10173. Keep in sync with
// auth.js's DEFAULT_PRIVACY_MD.
const DEFAULT_PRIVACY_MD = <<<'PRIVACY'
## 1. Overview
This Data Privacy Act Notice explains how Cana Optical Clinic ("the Clinic") collects, uses, stores, and protects your personal and sensitive personal information, in compliance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.

## 2. Information We Collect and Why
The Clinic collects the personal and sensitive personal information you provide during registration (e.g. name, date of birth, address, contact details) and through your subsequent care (e.g. examination results, diagnoses, prescriptions). This information is collected and processed solely for:
- Creating and maintaining your patient record
- Scheduling and managing appointments
- Providing optical examination, diagnosis, and treatment
- Generating your patient identification QR code
- Communicating with you regarding your account, appointments, or care
- Complying with legal and regulatory requirements

## 3. Storage and Security
Your data is stored on secured servers with access restricted to authorized clinic personnel (admin, staff, and your attending doctor) who need it to perform their duties. We apply reasonable organizational, physical, and technical safeguards to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.

## 4. Data Sharing
The Clinic does not sell or rent your personal information. Your data may only be shared with third parties when required by law, when necessary to provide your care (e.g. referrals), or with your explicit consent.

## 5. Data Retention
Your personal and health records are retained for as long as your account is active, and for the period required by applicable healthcare record-keeping regulations afterward, after which they are securely disposed of.

## 6. Your Rights as a Data Subject
Under the Data Privacy Act, you have the right to:
- Be informed of how your data is collected and processed
- Access the personal data the Clinic holds about you
- Request correction of inaccurate or outdated data
- Object to or withdraw consent for processing, subject to legal or contractual restrictions
- Request deletion of your data, where applicable
- File a complaint with the National Privacy Commission (NPC)

To exercise any of these rights, please contact the clinic directly using the contact details on our website.

## 7. Consent and Changes to this Notice
By checking "I agree" and completing registration, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this notice, and you consent to the collection, use, storage, and processing of your personal and sensitive personal information as described above, for the purpose of receiving care from Cana Optical Clinic — and you are entrusting your credentials and personal information to the Clinic on that basis. The Clinic may update this notice from time to time; continued use of your account after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the revised notice.

// Served whenever clinic_settings.appointment_policy_content is NULL.
// Same renderTermsMarkdown() convention as DEFAULT_TERMS_MD above. Section 4
// uses "> " so it keeps rendering as the original amber callout box instead
// of a plain paragraph.
// A function rather than a const so section 4 always states the *actual*
// configured reminder/confirm-deadline times (Clinic Settings → Scheduling
// Rules) instead of a hardcoded "noon"/"9:00 PM" that could silently drift
// out of sync with what the cron is really doing.

## 1. Appointment Requests
Appointment requests submitted through this system are subject to confirmation by clinic staff based on doctor availability. The clinic reserves the right to reschedule or decline requests when necessary.

## 2. Cancellations
If you can no longer make it to your appointment, please cancel as early as possible. This keeps the slot open for someone else who may need it.

## 3. Repeated No-Shows
If you miss multiple approved appointments without cancelling, online booking may be temporarily restricted for your account. In that case, please contact the clinic directly by phone or in person to schedule your next visit.

## 4. Appointment Reminders and Confirmation
> For approved appointments, we send a reminder at {$reminderTime} the day before your visit. Please confirm you'll be attending by {$confirmDeadlineTime} that same day. If we don't hear from you by then, the appointment is automatically cancelled so the slot can be offered to another patient.

## 5. Waitlist
If your preferred slot is fully booked, you can join the waitlist for it. If that slot opens up, you'll be notified with a limited time to claim it. If you don't respond in time, or choose to decline, the slot is offered to the next patient in line. You can only be on one waitlist at a time.
